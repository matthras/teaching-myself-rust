# Backstory

Near the end of 2020 I was evaluating my options and wanted to learn OOP, or at least a new systems-level programming language and was evaluating my options. At the time I was still having doubts about C++ and was figuring out the viability of Rust. After discovering that Rust could simply allow me to download a runtime and get started immediately in WSL and VS Code (as opposed to downloading a very large and unintuitive Visual Studio), I was sold on Rust.

# What to expect here?

This repo is an accumulation of notes/exercises/programs accumulated from teaching myself via various online means.

My background is that of a mostly self-taught amateur programmer who's done hobbyist stuff in Python, R, Julia and as such I know enough to bash out a script for the most part, but with no OOP experience. Most of my summary notes there will mostly pick up on what's 'new' to me in Rust.
