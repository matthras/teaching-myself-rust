* Starting a new project with cargo: `cargo new <project name>`

* Converting non-cargo project to cargo: generate .toml file and move code into /src/ folder.

* Build project: `cargo build`

* Run project: `cargo run`, alternative is `./target/debug/hello-cargo` which is obviously much too verbose

* Check if code compiles but no .exe: `cargo check`
